## Advanced methods

We developed a general model for (1) simulating catch from a year's worth of fishing activity and (2) simulating monitoring and review of that fishing catch. The model was split into a catch event module that modelled catch per set (Table S1) and a monitoring module that modelled monitoring and review of a sub-sample of all sets (Table S2). Simulation of catch and allocation of monitoring effort were both stochastic. This allowed us to explore how different monitoring scenarios impacted bias in estimated catch rates, with realistic levels of uncertainty. Specifically, our models accounted for uncertainty in: how much fishing activity happens in the coming year, how much catch is taken and by which vessels and on which trips, how monitoring coverage is allocated to fishing activities, what parts of the monitoring data are reviewed (e.g. what video is turned into data sheets that we can estimate catch from) and bias in how monitoring coverage is allocated. These different sources of uncertainty were important because a plan for monitoring needs to be made before the fishing activity happens. With our model, we then simulated replicate years of fishing to obtain catch bias estimates along with ranges of variability.

For the catch model we simulated the number of trips per vessel and number of sets per trip, as well as catch per set. Trips per vessel and sets per trip were modelled as random numbers, to reflect real world variation in their numbers. The number of vessels was fixed at 50. Catch per set was modelled as a random number with additive components for vessel identity and trip identity. This simulation of catches emulates the statistical analyses of catch, which often uses mixed effects models [e.g. @roberson2025opportunity; @gilman2012]. Therefore, catch events included covariation caused by vessel identity and trip identity.

The monitoring scenarios were modelled by randomly sampling sets, trips or vessels for monitoring. A proportion of sets (20%) was then selected within this sub-sample for data review. For the trip and vessel scenarios, a bias parameter was included such that monitoring coverage was biased towards trips or vessels with lower than average catch rates. We considered three monitoring scenarios, as described in the main text. For all of these scenarios the review rate as a proportion of the total sets would be on average 6% if our coverage is 30% and review rate is 20%. This division between coverage (e.g. what you collect video data for) and review (what you actually watch to get datasheets) is reflective of how real world fisheries operate. The total review quantity 6% on average across multiple replicate simulations, because in an individual simulation the actual review rate depends on the fishing activity model, which had stochastic elements. Therefore, our model is realistic to a situation a manager faces where they can allocate observers and cameras to vessels or trips, but they do not know ahead of time how much fishing will happen on those trips and vessels.

The random sampling of fishing activities and catch events was repeated to create 1000 datasets of annual fishing activities. Each monitoring scenario was then applied to each of the 1000 fishery datasets. The bias statistics were calculated as the difference between the true catch rate for that dataset and catch rate estimated by the monitoring scenario. The bias statistics therefore represent the difference between the estimated and true catch rates, conditional on each sample of catches. This conditional sampling is reflective of the situation managers face in the real world, where the observed catch rate differs from the true catch rate by an unknown amount. The confidence intervals across the 1000 simulations therefore represent our uncertainty about the accuracy of catch estimation in the coming year, given we know the number of vessels, but we don't yet know the number of trips, sets or catches those vessels will take.

For a given monitoring scenario *M* (Table S2) and catch data *y*, the estimated catch rate per set can be calculated as the average catch per set that was monitored and reviewed:

$$
\hat{C} = \frac{\sum{(y_{v,t,s} * M_{v,t,s})}}{\sum{M_{v,t,s}}}
$$

Where $y_{v,t,s}$ is a matrix of catches and $M_{v,t,s}$ is a matrix of 0/1 that indicates whether a given set was monitored and reviewed.

The true catch rate in each simulation, *C* was simply average catch per set.

We calculated two bias statistics, the absolute bias:

$$
B = C - \hat{C}
$$

and the bias as a percentage of the catch rate:

$$
100 * B / C
$$

The percent bias is what we present above, because it puts all scenarios on the same scale. The absolute bias was much smaller for rarer species and therefore hard to visualize in comparisons.

All parameters were chosen to be representative of the Western Pacific longline tuna fleets, data given in @brown2021electronic, parameters are in Tables S3-s5. The analysis was performed with the R program [@Rprogram]. The code are available online at <https://github.com/cbrown5/msc-review-rates>.
