# Pacific Fisheries Analysis: Simulation and Monitoring Approach

## Project Overview
- Objective: Analyze the impact of different monitoring strategies on bias and catch estimates
- Approach: Modular, straightforward implementation focusing on clarity and ease of navigation

## Proposed Implementation Structure

### Core Function 1: Data Simulation
- Purpose: Generate comprehensive catch dataset for an entire year
- Characteristics:
  - Follows hierarchical structure of fishery
  - Resembles a sampling/formation model
  - Creates baseline data for further analysis

### Core Function 2: Monitoring Strategy
- Purpose: Analyze simulated catch data
- Inputs: Dataset generated by Simulation Function
- Analysis Components:
  - Apply specific monitoring strategies
  - Calculate metrics:
    - Estimated catch track
    - Bias assessment
    - Device performance

## Parameter Management
- Strategy: Use simple, structured dataframes
- Dataframe Characteristics:
  - Columns: Represent different variables
  - Rows: Represent different fisheries or monitoring strategies
  - Keeps implementation clean and adaptable

## Design Principles
- Modularity: Clear, separate functions
- Simplicity: Avoid over-engineering
- Flexibility: Easy to modify and extend
