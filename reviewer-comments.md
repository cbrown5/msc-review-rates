# Reviewer comments

We obtained a review of this document and methods from an independent scientist. 

The reviewer made minor textual suggestions, which were accepted. 

There were also two comments, which are listed below, along with how we addressed them:

### Comments

**"How study was done" section.**

"How would you differentiate between flexible fishing strategies and varying skill levels? Both would result in vessel-level variation that may look the same? Or is the flexible fishing strategy catch event one that would have higher variation at the individual vessel level, whereas the differing expertise would have higher variation at the fleet level?"

Response: 
Agreed that both can cause variation across vessels. Doesn't matter here though as we are only interested in the amount of variation, not so much its cause. Have responded by adding this other suggestion for a cause of variation in the text. 

**Advanced methods** 

"Did you account for covariation among vessels in the number of sets and trips per vessel"

Response:
We added the text to the advanced methods: 
"For simplicity we did not consider correlations in the number of trips or sets per vessel (e.g. if some vessels consistently make fewer longer trips). This would require more detailed fisheries data for analysis than the summary statistics in published work. "
