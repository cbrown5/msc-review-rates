Need to check p_sets_select is working properly (results don't look right? )
Update documentation for p_sets_select
Work on plots for catch missed. 



For 1B: thanks for re-running the simulation. The specific real-world scenario weâ€™re interested in is comparison of 1) monitoring 30% of vessels and reviewing 100% of sets that are monitored with 2) monitoring 30% of vessels and reviewing 20% of sets that are monitored. This is because this is a common way the MSC guidance is interpreted. Is it possible to re-run the simulation for this comparison?


We are working to get a concrete timeline from MSC; in the meantime we are assuming:
Mid-July: have the statistical analysis complete; have a near-final word document of the entire report complete
End of July: complete an independent peer review of the report. Are you open to this idea, Chris? Independent peer review of the analysis could help it gain traction (regardless of the who the lead author is ðŸ˜Š). If you are open to this idea, is there anyone in mind who you think could provide this review?
Mid-August: format the report into a glossy PDF and finalize internally for sharing broadly.
Early-September: in-person meeting in Seattle with MSC. Will you still be in Vancouver CAN? If so, it would be great if you can join in-person. If youâ€™ll be back in AUS, we could have you join virtually.
Next internal meeting: Wed July 9 1:00 pm PT
