We are working to get a concrete timeline from MSC; in the meantime we are assuming:
Mid-July: have the statistical analysis complete; have a near-final word document of the entire report complete
End of July: complete an independent peer review of the report. Are you open to this idea, Chris? Independent peer review of the analysis could help it gain traction (regardless of the who the lead author is 😊). If you are open to this idea, is there anyone in mind who you think could provide this review?
Mid-August: format the report into a glossy PDF and finalize internally for sharing broadly.
Early-September: in-person meeting in Seattle with MSC. Will you still be in Vancouver CAN? If so, it would be great if you can join in-person. If you’ll be back in AUS, we could have you join virtually.
Next internal meeting: Wed July 9 1:00 pm PT
